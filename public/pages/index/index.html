    <p>This semester, we've been learning a lot about Full Stack Development.
        We've explored both the front-end and back-end parts of creating websites and apps.
        We've worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make nice-looking and easy-to-use interfaces.
        We've also learned about server-side programming using tools like Node.js and Express. </p>
